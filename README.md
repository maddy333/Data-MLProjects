Feature Engineering in Machine Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook dedicated to Feature Engineering techniques used in Machine Learning. Feature engineering is a crucial step in building effective models by transforming raw data into meaningful inputs that improve model performance.
Notebook: Feature_Engineering.ipynb
Overview

The notebook demonstrates:

    Techniques: Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, scaling/normalizing features, and feature selection.
    Libraries Used: Popular Python libraries like pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.
    Real-World Examples: Applies the techniques to datasets to show their practical importance in preparing data for Machine Learning algorithms.

Key Features

    Missing Data Handling:
        Techniques like imputation (mean, median, mode) and deletion.
        Handling missing categorical and numerical features.

    Categorical Encoding:
        One-hot encoding, label encoding, and target encoding.

    Feature Scaling and Normalization:
        Standardization (z-score scaling).
        Min-Max scaling and robust scaling.

    Feature Selection:
        Filtering methods (correlation threshold, chi-square test).
        Wrapper methods (RFE - Recursive Feature Elimination).
        Embedded methods (Lasso regression and tree-based models).
